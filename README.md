## Project Setup

Please follow the instructions below to setup the project:

### Clone the Repository

First, we need to clone the repository. Open your terminal, navigate to your desired directory, and run the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/username/satellite-web-app.git
```

### Navigate into the Project Directory

Once cloning is complete, navigate into the new project directory with this command:

```
cd satellite-web-app
```

### Install Dependencies

Now we'll install the project's dependencies. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. To install the dependencies, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

or

```
yarn
```

### Start the Development Server

Finally, start the development server with this command:

```
npm run dev
```

or

```
yarn dev
```

The project should now be running at
`http://localhost:5173`
or a different port if `5173` is already in use.

### Building for Production

When you're ready to build for production, use the following command:

```
npm run build
```

or

```
yarn build
```

This will generate a dist directory with everything you need to deploy the application.
